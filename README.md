Use Python3 to run with files

Example:
```python
python part1.py
```

There are a total of 5 files:
part1.py, part2.py, part3.py, part4.py, part4b.py

The team implemented 2 designs for Part 4:

1. part4.py uses the Add-One smoothing / Laplace smoothing design

2. part4b.py uses the trigram HMM design
